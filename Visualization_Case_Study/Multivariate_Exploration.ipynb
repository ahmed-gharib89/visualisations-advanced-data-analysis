You saw that the log of price was approximately linearly related to the cube root of carat weight, as analogy to its length, width, and depth. You also saw that there was an unintuitive relationship between price and the categorical quality measures of cut, color, and clarity, that the median price decreased with increasing quality. Investigating the distributions more clearly and looking at the relationship between carat weight with the three categorical variables showed that this was due to carat size tending to be smaller for the diamonds with higher categorical grades.\n",

With the number of category combinations to be plotted (7x5 = 35), it's hard to make full sense of a violin plot's narrow areas; simplicity is better. A clustered bar chart could work, but considering that price should be on a log scale, there isn't really a nice baseline that would work well.</span>"
