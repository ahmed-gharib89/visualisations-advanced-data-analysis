It would be nice to have a linear trend, wouldn't it? It turns out that the x, y, and z dimensions track a much more linear trend against price than carat does. Since carat is more recognizable a feature value, let's add a transformation to the x-axis to see the approximately linear trend. Since weight is proportional to volume, and since all the diamonds are cut in approximately the same way (round-cut), a cube-root transformation of carat should allow us to see an approximately linear trend.</span>"

For diamonds above about 1.5 carats, we'd probably expect some diamonds about $20,000 in price, given the trend below 1.5 carats. This would be a point to potentially pay attention to later on with interaction effects between other factors, and when building a model of diamond prices.</span>"

If you created a box plot, then you probably noticed something interesting and unintuitive: the median price of diamonds should tend to look like it _decrease_ with _increasing_ gem quality. Shouldn't we expect this to be the other way around? This deserves a deeper look. Is there a different plot type to choose that shows more details in the data?</span>"

Faceted histograms will also produce a similar result, though unless the faceting keeps the price axis common across facets, the trend will be harder to see. For each ordinal variable, there are multiple modes into which prices appear to fall. Going across increasing quality levels, you should see that the modes rise in price - this should be the expected effect of quality. However, you should also see that more of the data will be located in the lower-priced modes - this explains the unintuitive result noted in the previous comment. This is clearest in the clarity variable. Let's keep searching the data to see if there's more we can say about this pattern.</span>"

Larger diamonds are more likely to receive lower categorical quality grades, while high quality grades are more likely to have their numbers made up of smaller diamonds.
